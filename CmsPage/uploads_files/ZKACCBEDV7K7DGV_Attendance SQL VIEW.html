<p><strong>Attendance - API</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scenario:&nbsp; </strong>Biometric attendance systems utilize unique biological characteristics such as fingerprints, Biometric data is unique to each individual data punch captured in Local Server which this data manually restores in the Server (API Studio Attendance Database) in Public Schema. The data collection should be converted into readable format using API Studio SQL View.</p>
<p><strong>Why Attendance API: </strong>Biometric system not able to give the Breaking Time report, So We tried in the SQL View Attendance API. SQL View is having a Two Tables are Employee master and Iclock Transaction Table. Iclock transaction is every day biometric punching data, employee master is the details of the employee.</p>
<p><strong>SQL Columns</strong> - Employee Code, First Name (Employee Name), Punch Date, Punch Time, Sl. No, Attendance Status.</p>
<p><strong>Sl. No &amp; Attendance Status</strong></p>
<p>0 is the <strong>Absent</strong> how to identify the absent an employee does not punch in via a biometric attendance system</p>
<p>1 is the <strong>Check in</strong> of Attendance Status how to identify this status an employee punch in between 06:00 am to 10:30 am in case of multiple punch is available Minimum time will be taken.</p>
<p>1.1 is <strong>Half an Hour Late </strong>employee punching time in between 10:31 am to 12:59, In case of multiple punch is available maximum time will be taken</p>
<p>2 is the <strong>Lunch Breaking Log Out </strong>employee punching time in between 01:00 to 01:30 In case of multiple punch is available maximum time will be taken</p>
<p>3 is the <strong>Lunch Breaking Log In</strong> employee punching time in between 01:31 to 02:00 In case of multiple punch is available maximum time will be taken</p>
<p>3.1 is the <strong>Lunch Breaking Log in Late</strong> employee punching time in between 02:01 to 03:00 In case of multiple punch is available maximum time will be taken</p>
<p>3.2 is <strong>Half Day Leave </strong>last punch is the in between 02:01 to 02:30 and not a checkout in between 06:00 to 10:00pm, it should not be lunch breaking log in late</p>
<p>4 is the <strong>Checkout </strong>employee punching time in between 06:00 to 10:00 pm In case of multiple punch is available maximum time will be taken</p>
<p>4.1 is the <strong>Early Checkout&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;employee punching time in between 03:01 to 05:59 pm In case of multiple punch is available maximum time will be taken</p>
<p><strong>Output</strong></p>
<p>In future This API should be configure in Help Desk Application one of the Attendance Screen. &nbsp;This Attendance Screen should be visible employee data in Date wise&nbsp; along with Attendance Status. Each Day we need a Four punch. If the date is fall in Sunday or public holiday need to show report. Each employee attendance screen shows his/her data only. Admin rights person can see the all the employee data. Attendance summary report has to create, attendance Detail report has to create using this API.</p>
